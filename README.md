trade. You can narrow it down choosing its category and a minimum 
nutriscore.


#### **What does it do?**

It is a food substitute finder. Search for a product you like, choose
from the list, and it will display the same kind of products than the 
one you chose but with a better nutriscore.
If you're logged in, you can save the products which will retain 
your attention and browse it later in your saved products section.
You can then remove it from your favorites whenever you like.
